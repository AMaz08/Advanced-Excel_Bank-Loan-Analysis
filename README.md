In order to monitor and assess bank's lending activities and performance, we have created a comprehensive Bank Loan Report.The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.
